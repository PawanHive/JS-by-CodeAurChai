==> Most project don't need react in initial phase

WHY REACT WAS CREATED? 
==> Ghost(phantom message problem) message problem
==> No Consistency in UI

state --> JS      &       UI --> DOM

Khan Academy --> Unplash......used React for the first time


DON'T LEARN REACT IF: 
==> you don't know how JS works or DOM works ( WATCH MY: BROWSER inner working video on english channel)

REACT LEARNING PROCESS: 
==> GO IN-DEPTH
        - babel, fibre, virtual DOM, diff algo, hydration
==> BY MAKING PROJECTS (ONE TOPIC AT A TIME)
        - todo, calculator, Github API

REACT IS A LIBRARAY:
==> FRAMEWORKD(military)    vs      Library(cooldood)

TOPICS TO LEARN:
==> Core of React (state or UI manipulation, JSX)
==> Component Reusability
==> Reusing of component (Props)
==> How to propagate change (hooks)

ADDITIONAL ADDON TO REACT: 
==> Router (React don't have Router)
==> state management (react don't have state management)
    ==> Redux, Redux toolkit, zustand, context API

 --> React is not a complete solution in most case 
    -> no seo, brwoser render of JS, no routing
 --> Frame work
    -> Next JS, Gatsby, Remix
