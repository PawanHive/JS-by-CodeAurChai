/*
üß© 2. What is Lexical Scope?
    Lexical scope means:
    ==> ‚ÄúThe scope of a variable is determined by where it is written in the source code, not by where or when it is called.‚Äù

    ==> So, lexical = by location in code.
    ==> In other words, JavaScript decides which variables you can access based on where your function is defined, not where it‚Äôs executed.
*/

/*
üéØ Purpose of Lexical Scope
In simple words:

    ==> Lexical scope allows inner functions to access variables from their outer (parent) functions,
        so that functions can share and reuse data safely without global variables.
