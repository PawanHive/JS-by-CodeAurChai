//+++++++++++++++++++++ De-Structuring of Objects +++++++++++++++++++++++++
// de-structuring array ki bhi hoti hai or Objects ki bhi hoti hai hai

const course = {
    coursename: 'JS in Hindi', 
    price: '999', 
    courseInstructor: 'Hitesh'
}

//==> here TWO ways to access object
// 1st:
console.log(course.courseInstructor)  //Output: Hitesh   // this is perfect way to print buy to print multiple time you have right multiple time which not good (clean code)

// 2nd: (this is actually De-Structuring Concept)
const {courseInstructor} = course // SYNTAX**       //this make looks code more clean 
console.log(courseInstructor)    //Output: Hitesh

const {courseInstructor: Instructor} = course // SYNTAX**       // here property name (courseInstructor) renamed to (Instructor)
console.log(Instructor)    //Output: Hitesh       // as property name renamed above to (Instructor), so we can print by this new name(Instructor) and will get same value

// JSON FORMAT API LOOKS IN TWO WAYS:

//==> 1st:
{
    "name": "hitesh",                   //remember JSON API's keys(property name) are written in string("") and covered under object only symbol{}, not declared variable exit.
    "coursename": "js in hindi", 
    "price": "free"
}

//==> 2nd:  sometime API comes in Array form with many inside Objects (this is also JSON FORMAT API)
[
    {},
    {},
    {}
]

//==> NOTE: (randomuserme api) is most famous on google and here is link(https://randomuser.me/api/) and to understand this API most people use (JSON FORMATTER TOOL) and here is link of TOOL(https://jsonformatter.org/)...this tool can convert API into CODE, FORM, TEXT, TREE, VIEW... to understand better
