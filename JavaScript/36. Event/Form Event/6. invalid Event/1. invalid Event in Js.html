<!-- 
🧠 What is the invalid event?

==> The invalid event is fired when a form field fails validation.
==> It happens before the form is submitted and only for form controls (like <input>, <select>, <textarea>).
==> The event is triggered automatically by the browser when:

    ==> A required field is empty.
    ==> The input value doesn’t match its type (like text in an email field).
    ==> The value doesn’t match a pattern or is outside min/max range. 
-->

<!-- 
🕒 When to use it

    ==> Use the invalid event when you want to:
    ==> Show custom error messages.
    ==> Highlight invalid fields (like turning their border red).
    ==> Track validation errors before submission.
-->

<!-- 
🌍 Where it’s used

Commonly used in:
    ==> Signup/login forms (to validate email, password length, etc.)
    ==> Feedback/contact forms
    ==> Payment and checkout forms (to ensure valid card numbers or ZIP codes)
    ==> Survey forms (to ensure all required questions are answered)
