<!-- 
1. The returnValue property

    ==> It’s a special property of the beforeunload event.

    ==> When you assign any string to it (even an empty string),
    the browser knows: “This page wants to confirm before unloading.”

So, e.returnValue = "" means →
“Hey browser, don’t close immediately. Ask the user for confirmation.”

2. Modern browsers’ behavior

    ==> For security and user experience, browsers no longer show your custom message.
    ==> They display their own generic dialog like:
        “Changes you made may not be saved.”
    ==> Still, setting e.returnValue (even to "") is required to trigger that dialog.
